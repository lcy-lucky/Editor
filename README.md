The code we submit is divided into three parts: detection, location, and repair.
Detection: Run att_t_u_train, att_tu_cal_tp, and att_t_u_test in sequence through “python XX.py”.
Location: Run speed+kmeans through “python XX.py”.
Repair: Run tcn_gcn_train+test through “python XX.py”.
Parameters and architectures can be modified according to your own situation.
